# IT Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my journey into IT infrastructure.  
My goal is to build a strong foundation in five core areas that are essential for modern IT environments:

1. **Operating Systems** â€“ Focus on Linux and system internals  
2. **Networks** â€“ Understanding protocols, services, and security  
3. **Coding** â€“ Developing problem-solving skills with programming  
4. **Databases** â€“ Learning data models, queries, and administration  
5. **Docker & Virtualization** â€“ Modern deployment and infrastructure practices
